## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. I am going to use markdown for most in class exercises. 
``` {r simple random smapling}
#Create a vector of data
rm(list=ls()) # Clear everything. 
set.seed(09222008) #Always set seed for replicability
some_population <- c(100, 200, 300, 400, 500) 
  
#Sample 2 values with replacement
sampled_numbers <- sample (some_population, size = 2, replace = TRUE) 
print(sampled_numbers)

# But what about a deck of cards? No Replacement?
deck <- 1:52
shuffled_deck <- sample(deck, size = length(deck), replace = FALSE)
hand_size <- 5
hand <- shuffled_deck[1:hand_size]
print(hand)

# Cute Max. But we are scientists. We mostly sample from data frames. How do you do that? OK. 

# Create a data frame
some_population_df <- data.frame(
Name = c("Shaily","Keyu","Santiago","David","Nayeli","Srishti","Chelsea","Chelsea","Kaiwen","Sang Min","Alex","Wenjia","Jerra","Citlalli","Lu","Mina","Muhammad","Shufan","Zhilie", "Eloise Wenxi", "Riza", "Iris", "Emelia", "Yuxuan", "Jonathan", "Christian", "Max", "Qinuo"),
fav_number = c(25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 30, 35, 40, 45, 30, 35, 40, 45, 30, 35, 40, 45, 30, 35, 40, 45, 30, 35, 40, 45, 30, 35, 40)
)

# Sample 2 rows with replacement
sampled_df <- some_population_df[sample(nrow(some_population_df), size = 3, replace = FALSE), ]
print(sampled_df)



# Sometimes we want to take repeated samples (Monte Carlo!)
# Define a population vector
k_pop <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100)
 
# Replicate sampling 5 times without replacement
replicated_samples <- replicate(5, sample(k_pop, size = 3, replace = FALSE))
 
# Print the replicated samples
print(replicated_samples)

#What about dplyr?

# Create a sample data frame
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(09222008)  
library(dplyr)
data <- data.frame(
  ID = 1:100,
  Value = rnorm(100)
)
 
# Randomly sample 10 rows from the data frame
sampled_data <- data %>%
  sample_n(10)
 
# View the sampled data
print(sampled_data)

```


```{r cluster_sample_simulate}

head(df)
clusters <- sample(unique(df$sections), size=4, replace=F)
sample <- df[df$sections %in% clusters, ]
table(sample$sections)
```


```{r weather}

mean(x$tMax)
mean(x$tMin)

# Choose a number of clusters. If you have to go measure things, it is costly to add more trips!!!
clusters_w <- sample(unique(x$fips), size=4, replace=F)
sample_w <- x[x$fips %in% clusters_w, ]
mean(sample_w$tMax)
mean(sample_w$tMin)
