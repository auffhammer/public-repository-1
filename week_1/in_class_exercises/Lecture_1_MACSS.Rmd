## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. I am going to use markdown for most in class exercises. 
``` {r simple random smapling}
#Create a vector of data
rm(list=ls()) # Clear everything. 
set.seed(09222008) #Always set seed for replicability
some_population <- c(100, 200, 300, 400, 500) 
  
#Sample 2 values with replacement
sampled_numbers <- sample (some_population, size = 2, replace = TRUE) 
print(sampled_numbers)

# But what about a deck of cards? No Replacement?
deck <- 1:52
shuffled_deck <- sample(deck, size = length(deck), replace = FALSE)
hand_size <- 5
hand <- shuffled_deck[1:hand_size]
print(hand)

# Cute Max. But we are scientists. We mostly sample from data frames. How do you do that? OK. 

# Create a data frame

# Sometimes we want to take repeated samples (Monte Carlo!)
# Define a population vector

# Replicate sampling 5 times without replacement

#What about dplyr?

# Create a sample data frame
# Set seed for reproducibility

  Value = rnorm(100)

  sample_n(10)
 
# View the sampled data
print(sampled_data)
